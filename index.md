# Projects

## aqicalc

A library to convert between AQI value and pollutant concentration
(µg/m³ or ppm) using the following algorithms:

- United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
- China Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP)
- Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) India
- Kuwait AQI
- IEMA Brazil
- CAQI Europe

Forked from python-aqi library

## gspatial-plot

![](https://gspatial-plot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/logo.png)

A geospatial plotting library built on top of geopandas. The aim of this library is to simplify generation of various geospatial plot and provide a simple interface to various commonly used geospatial plot types.

Some of the features include:

- Simple API

- Better defaults compared to vanilla geopandas plot

- Customizations made simple

- Compatible with other geopandas or matplotlib axis objects

- Provides functions for plotting bubbleplots, cartograms, heatmaps, spikemaps and densityplots

## Geospatial Data Science Catalog

This project catalogs and organizes various open access resources for geospatial data science. The catalog is organized into libraries (for python), courses, datasets, websites, tools and github repos. This list is constantly being updated with new resources.
