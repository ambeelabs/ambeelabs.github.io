> A geospatial plotting library built on top of geopandas. The aim of this library is to simplify generation of various geospatial plot and provide a simple interface to various commonly used geospatial plot types.

Some of the features include:

- Simple API

- Better defaults compared to vanilla geopandas plot

- Customizations made simple

- Compatible with other geopandas or matplotlib axis objects

- Provides functions for plotting bubbleplots, cartograms, heatmaps, spikemaps and densityplots
